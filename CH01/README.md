## Installing Cloudera Virtual Machine on Mac

Setting up Cloudera Virtual Machine is very similar to setting up on the windows. If you have a Mac OS X, we can set up Cloudera Quickstart Virtual Machine with VirtualBox on MAC. Follow the instructions as given below:

- Installing VirtualBox. Simply, go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and download the virtual box. Once downloaded, install VirtualBox in your OS X. 
- Secondly, download the Cloudera Virtual Machine. You can download the Cloudera VM from https://downloads.cloudera.com/demo_vm/virtualbox/cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0-virtualbox.zip. The VM is over 4GB, so will take some time to download.
- Unzip the Cloudera Virtual Machine. You can do this by simply double clicking on the folder cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0-virtualbox.zip
- Start the VirtualBox and begin importing. We can import the VM by going to File -> Import Appliance
Click the Folder icon and select the cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0-virtualbox.ovf from the folder where you unzipped the - VirtualBox Virtual Machine and click Open.
- Click Continue to proceed.
- Click Import.
- The virtual machine image will be imported. As this is a big file, it can take some time.
- When the importing is finished, lunch the Cloudera Virtual Machine. The quickstart-vm-5.4.2-0 VM will appear on the left in the VirtualBox window. Select the machine and click the Start button to initiate the Virtual Machine.
- It takes several minutes for Cloudera VM booting start up initially. It takes a long time since many Hadoop tools are loaded and started at this booting process.
- Once the booting process is finished, you will see the Cloudera VM desktop on the screen like the screenshot given below:
